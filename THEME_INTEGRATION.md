## ðŸŽ¯ How Merchants Can Use Forms in Their Theme

### Method 1: Using the Snippet (Recommended)

The easiest way for merchants to add forms to their theme is by using the `shopiform-display` snippet.

#### Step 1: Create a Custom Section (One-time setup)

Merchants need to create a new section file in their theme:

**File:** `sections/shopiform-section.liquid`

```liquid
<div class="shopiform-section-wrapper">
  {% render 'shopiform-display', 
    form_id: section.settings.form_id, 
    heading: section.settings.heading, 
    description: section.settings.description 
  %}
</div>

{% schema %}
{
  "name": "ShopiForm",
  "tag": "section",
  "class": "section-shopiform",
  "settings": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "id": "heading",
      "label": "Heading",
      "default": "Contact Us"
    },
    {
      "type": "textarea",
      "id": "description",
      "label": "Description",
      "info": "Optional description to display above the form"
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "id": "form_id",
      "label": "Form ID",
      "info": "Enter the ID of the form from your ShopiForm app dashboard"
    }
  ],
  "presets": [
    {
      "name": "ShopiForm"
    }
  ]
}
{% endschema %}
```

#### Step 2: Use the Section

1. Go to **Theme Customizer**
2. Click **"Add section"**
3. Select **"ShopiForm"**
4. Enter the **Form ID** from your ShopiForm app dashboard
5. Optionally add a heading and description
6. **Save** and **Publish**

### Method 2: Direct Snippet Usage

Merchants can also use the snippet directly in any template:

```liquid
{% render 'shopiform-display', 
  form_id: 'your-form-id-here', 
  heading: 'Contact Us', 
  description: 'Get in touch with us!' 
%}
```

## ðŸ“‹ Instructions for Merchants

### Getting the Form ID

1. Open your **ShopiForm app**
2. Go to the **Forms** list
3. Find your form and copy the **Form ID** shown below the form name
4. Paste this ID into the theme customizer

### Adding Forms to Pages

1. **Theme Customizer** â†’ **Add Section** â†’ **ShopiForm**
2. **Page Templates** â†’ Add the snippet directly
3. **Product Pages** â†’ Use in product description templates
4. **Blog Posts** â†’ Add to article templates

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

The forms automatically inherit your theme's styling, but you can customize them further by adding CSS to your theme:

```css
.shopiform-wrapper {
  /* Custom container styling */
}

.shopiform-form {
  /* Custom form styling */
}

.shopiform-submit-btn {
  /* Custom button styling */
}
```

- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
